                <h1><u>Ageing</u></h1>
                <p>The world's population is ageing. Virtually every country in the world is 
                    experiencing growth in the number and proportion of older persons in their population. <br> <br>
                Population ageing is poised to become one of the most significant social
                    transformations of the twenty-first century, with implications for nearly all sectors of society,
                including labour and financial markets, the demand for goods and services, such as housing, transportation
                and social protection, as well as family structures and intergenerational
                ties.</p>
                
                <p>Older persons are increasingly seen as contributors to development, whose abilities to act for 
                    the betterment of themselves and their societies should be woven into policies and
                programmes at all levels. In the coming decades, many countries are likely to face fiscal
                and political pressures in relation to public systems of health care, pensions and social 
                protections for a growing older population.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Diabetes</h2>
        <p>Diabetes is a condition that affects how your body turns food into sugar (glucose). 
        This sugar is your body's main source of energy. With diabetes, your body doesn't make enough 
        insulin, or it can't use insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose get into your 
        cells to be used for energy.</p>

            <h4>Types of diabetes:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> Type 1 diabetes</li>

                <li> Gestational diabetes</li>

            </ul>
            
            <h4>How diabetes progresses:</h4>
            
            <p>Diabetes can damage blood vessels and nerves throughout 
            your body. This can lead to serious complications, including heart
             disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, and nerve damage.</p>
